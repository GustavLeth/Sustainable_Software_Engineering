repository for Chrome extension for marginal co2 emissions

We want to make a website that uses the api of carbon intensity for the eletrical grid. It's a chrome plugin to analyze network traffic.
So the website measures the marginal co2 increase of a person using power, so it monitors an entire session for a user.
The plugin measures the co2 emitted from that, by looking at the marginal energy grid. It measures the data recieved and sent by the users device and the reciever would use. It then visualizes it for a user, with metrics such as how much money it costs, and whatever else we can figure out.
