The currently existing options for measuring carbon when using the internet, is limited to measuring 
the specific website that you are visiting. This can give you an idea of how good the idividual website 
is for the environment. However, this information is limited to only the base version of the website you
visit and to individual website. This can make it hard for the end user to grasp the amount of data that
they actually use during a browsing session. Our tool measures the entire session in real time. This
means that the user at any time can se how much they have spend in the session and can se the total
spend. This can be a crusial tool to make the general web user realize how much energy using the internet
consumes. Furthermore, we want to present this data in a way that the general public can relate to. 
Units like CO_2 equivalent or kWh are hard to grasp and therefore not optimal for educational purposes.
