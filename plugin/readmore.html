      <p>This chrome extension calculates the energy usage during a browsing session. <br>
      <br>
      It does so by checking the amount of data which the browser recieves and then calculates how much energi that takes. <br>
      From this we connect the IP adress to a given country/region to find how energy was created. From this we can calculate the CO2 equivalent from the energi used in the session and transform this number to an easy to grasp equivalent. <br>
      <br>


      To calculate the energy usage we use the ratio 0.81 kWh/GB. This number is from "https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/". <br>
      This number was chosen since there is no consensus on one "true" number for this,  looking at "Electricity Intensity of Internet DataTransmission" by J. Alsan and K. Mayers from 2015, we can see that the energy consumption pr. data unit varies up to five orders of magnitude. <br>
      From this we use an IP registry to find which country/region the IP belongs to. We then connect to the XXXXXXXXXX api to find the average CO2 pr. kWh. <br>


      <br>
      Continued work: <br>
      Making a tier list of which websites was used the most during the session and show the amount of CO2 used on each. <br>
